# Exercise_Rep_Counter
Project created using OpenCV and Mediapipe
The project utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to estimate the posture of users during realtime workouts, such as squats, push-ups, and bicep curls. By analyzing body landmarks from webcam images, the system calculates body angles and other metrics to assess posture accuracy. It enables individuals to exercise at home without a personal trainer, providing feedback to maintain proper form and prevent injuries.
